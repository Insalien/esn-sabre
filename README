## OpenPaaS Frontend for SabreDAV

Welcome to the OpenPaaS frontend for [SabreDAV](http://sabre.io/). This frontend
adds calendaring and address book capabilities to your OpenPaaS instance and
allows you to access them via standard CalDAV and CardDAV clients like
Lightning.

### Setting up the Environment

The OpenPaaS frontend is managed through [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), all
requirements can easily be set up using:

```bash
composer update
```

This command can be repeated to update package versions.

### Unit tests and codestyle

To run the unit tests, first make sure you have updated the environment, then
you can use the following command. It will generate a nice report in the
`tests/report` subdirectory.

```bash
cd tests
phpunit --coverage-html report .
```

Running the code style checker is also just a matter of executing the right
command. The style checker is installed by composer, we use the same code
style as sabre-dav.

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpcs -p --standard=vendor/sabre/dav/tests/phpcs/ruleset.xml lib/
```
