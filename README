## OpenPaaS Frontend for SabreDAV

Welcome to the OpenPaaS frontend for [SabreDAV](http://sabre.io/). This
frontend adds calendaring and address book capabilities to your OpenPaaS
instance and allows you to access them via standard CalDAV and CardDAV clients
like Lightning.

### Setting up the Environment

The OpenPaaS frontend is managed through [composer](https://getcomposer.org/),
all requirements can easily be set up using:

```bash
composer update
```

This command can be repeated to update package versions.

### Unit tests and codestyle

A simple Makefile exists to make it easier to run the tests and check code
style. The following commands are available:

```bash
make test                        # Run all tests
make test TARGET=tests/CalDAV/   # Run only certain tests
make test-report                 # Run tests and create a coverage report

make lint                        # Check code style for the whole project
make lint TARGET=lib/            # Check only certain files for lint
```

The coverage report will be placed in the `tests/report` directory, a clickable
link will be presented when done.
